# Exercise 1: Cats
# Instructions
# Using this class
# class Cat:
#     def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
#         self.name = cat_name
#         self.age = cat_age
# Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.
# Outside of the class, create a function that finds the oldest cat
# and returns the cat.
# Print the following string: “The oldest cat is <cat_name>,
# and is <cat_age> years old.”. Use the function previously created

class Cat:

    def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
        self.name = cat_name
        self.age = cat_age

print(
    f"The oldest cat is {oldest_cat.name}, and is {oldest_cat.age} years old.")

#  Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog.
# In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters :
#  name and height. This function instantiates two attributes,
# which values are the parameters.
# Create a method called bark that prints the following string “<dog_name>
# goes woof!”.
# Create a method called jump that prints the following string “<dog_name>
# jumps <x> cm high!”. x is the height*2.
# Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog’s name
# is “Rex” and his height is 50cm.
# Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods
# bark and jump.
# Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog’s name is “Teacup” and
# his height is 20cm.
# Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods
# bark and jump.
# Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger.
# Print the name of the bigger dog.


class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, height):
        self.name = name
        self.height = height

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} goes woof")

    def jump(self):
        jump_height = self.height * 2
        print(f"{self.name} jumps {jump_height} cm")


davids_dog = Dog('Rex', 50)
print(f"David's dog is {davids_dog.name} and it's {davids_dog.height} cm")
davids_dog.bark()
davids_dog.jump()

saras_dog = Dog('Teacup', 80)
print(f"Sara's dog is {saras_dog.name} and it's {saras_dog.height} cm")
saras_dog.bark()
saras_dog.jump()

if davids_dog.height > saras_dog.height:
    print(f"{davids_dog.name} is bigger than {saras_dog.name}")
else:
    print(f"{saras_dog.name} is bigger than {davids_dog.name}")


# Exercise 3 : Who’s The Song Producer?
# Instructions
# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints
# each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object, for example:
# stairway= Song(["There’s a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold",
# "and she’s buying a stairway to heaven"])
# Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

# There’s a lady who's sure
# all that glitters is gold
# and she’s buying a stairway to heaven

class Song:
    def __init__(self, lyrics):
        self.lyrics = lyrics

    def sing_me_a_song(self):
        for new_line in self.lyrics:
            print(new_line)


stairway = Song(["There's a lady who's sure", "all that glitters is gold",
                "and she's buying a stairway to heaven"])
stairway.sing_me_a_song()

# Exercise 4 : Afternoon At The Zoo
# Instructions
# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name
# (name of the zoo).
# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal.
# This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isn’t
# already in the list.
# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
# Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold.
# This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs
# to exist in the list.
# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically
# and groups them together based on their first letter.
# Example
# {
#     1: "Ape",
#     2: ["Baboon", "Bear"],
#     3: ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
#     4: ['Eel', 'Emu']
# }
# Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.
# Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.
# Tip: The zookeeper is the one who will use this class.
# Example
# Which animal should we add to the zoo --> Giraffe
# x.add_animal(Giraffe)
