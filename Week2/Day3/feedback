Hey there! I checked your code for the first daily challenge problem, and while it's a good start,
there are a couple of things you could improve:

First, you should ask the user to input a word, so that your code can work with any input string.

Second, you can simplify your code by creating an empty dictionary first,
and then adding each letter to the dictionary with an empty list as the value.

Finally, you can loop through the string using the enumerate function to get both the index and the letter at each position. 
Then you can add the index to the list for the current letter in the dictionary.

Here's an example code that you can use as a reference:

word = input('Enter a word: ')

frequencies = {}

for index, letter in enumerate(word):
    if letter not in frequencies:
        frequencies[letter] = []
    frequencies[letter].append(index)

print(frequencies)

I hope this helps you! Let me know if you have any questions.
